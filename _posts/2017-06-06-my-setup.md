For my inaugural post, six months after I set up this repository, I thought I'd
just talk about my personal technology setup.

For context, I built my current desktop PC in August 2016, so at the time, the
i7 6700K and the GTX 1080 were just about highest performance parts available,
within a sane price range. On the CPU side, Intel has announced its i9 lineup
and AMD has announced its Ryzen Threadripper, and on the GPU side, Nvidia has
released the 1080 Ti and the Titan XP. However, I think the rate of progress in
PC hardware in the past 10 months has vindicated my purchase decisions.

The main indulgence I had was the choice of SSD, which was clearly overkill -
the marginal performance gains of an M.2 NVMe SSD over a plain old SATA are not
worth the drastically higher prices, at least for my use cases, since I rarely
do anything storage-intensive. Also, I could probably have invested money in an
AiO water cooler for my CPU; though not necessary, it'd have been easier to
install, would run quieter, and be more aesthetically pleasing.

Onto peripherals.

I chose to invest in a single "ultrawide" aspect ratio monitor
(i.e. 21:9 rather than the more common 16:9), which is also curved and
"overclocks" to a 100Hz refresh rate (why it doesn't simply ship with 100Hz is a
mystery). Alternative options, of course, included 4K displays, higher refresh
rate gaming monitors, and using a dual or even triple monitor setup. However,
even with the powerful GPUs available today, there isn't, in my opinion, one
which can deliver satisfactory performance at 4K, and since I don't game
competitively, there's really no point in going any higher than 100Hz.

I purchased my first mechanical keyboard, the Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate, during
the same time period as I built my PC. However, craving a better keyboard
experience, I finally decided to take the leap and bought a Kinesis Advantage2.
The learning curve has certainly been interesting, and I still prefer the
clickier Cherry MX Blue switches, but the Advantage2 is well-designed indeed.
I don't have the time at the moment, and I think I'd rather hold off on spending
even more on my keyboard setup for now, but I'd like to either order custom or
DIY my board with Blue switches (and blank caps, but that part's not much work).

As for my mouse, it's plenty ergonomic already, it does its job, and it's
wireless. Maybe if I took gaming more seriously I'd have good reason to
apportion more of my budget there, but since I try to have a mouseless
experience outside of gaming, I simply haven't felt any need to change mice in
the past 3 years. Likewise, I recently replaced my headset after an unfortunate
accident, but it's nothing particularly special; I chose it as a value pick for
the disproportionately good audio and mic quality.

Moving past the basics of my desktop setup at home, there are a few important
gadgets I carry with me enough to warrant a mention.

First, unsurprisingly, my smartphone. I've had Samsung and HTC phones in the
past, and in general I'm an Android enthusiast. So, also unsurprisingly, the
phone I've had since March 2016 is the Nexus 6P.

Next, my laptop/tablet 2-in-1, the Surface Pro 3. A laptop is a must have for a
computer science student, of course, but the ability to turn into a tablet,
especially for note taking, is invaluable.

And finally, for transportation, a 2nd generation Boosted Dual+ board, capable
of going up to 22mph (35kph) and 6-7 miles (11km).

Lastly, and most importantly, the software. Not much code to speak of, but
still, technically, some. The editor I'm using to write this post, and which I
generally default to, is [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org). It's an Emacs
distribution which emulates the keybinding organization of Vim, not only in text
editing through evil-mode, but in all the myriad plugins which it's bundled with
or makes available through a simple config change. Spacemacs is a bit of a
guilty pleasure, quite honestly, as it satisfies my conflicting desires for
IDE-like and Vim-like experiences. The lack of need for spending hours
customizing it is precisely why I use it, even though that's rather antithetical
to the Emacs philosophy.

Unfortunately, I'm also a Windows user most of the time (also, coincidentally,
antithetical to the Emacs philosophy). Before getting the Advantage2, with its
convenient thumb clusters, I used [AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com) to map
caps lock key to esc when pressed alone and ctrl in a chord. The AHK script is
available [here](https://gist.github.com/sedm0784/4443120). When it's more
convenient to do some task in a Linux distro, I prefer to use a VM rather than
dual boot, and my tool of choice here is [Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org),
running a headless [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net) VM to SSH into. Microsoft's
recent endeavors in its Windows Subsystem for Linux are pretty interesting, but
having tried it in its infancy (public beta) a little over a year ago, I've held
off on making the switch over entirely.

Since I rarely write shell scripts, or in general take advantage of particularly
advanced features, I usually stick with bash. Since I haven't set up WSL yet, I
need an alternative option for the native Windows
environment. [Cmder](http://cmder.net) is my terminal emulator of choice on
Windows, and I've recently picked up [xonsh](http://xon.sh) as an alternative
shell. I'm not sure that I expect to use it much differently than bash, but
since I've been using Python more and more frequently, perhaps there will be
some benefit.

My barely-edited dotfiles for both Spacemacs and xonsh are
in [this repo](https://github.com/rationalis/dotfiles).
