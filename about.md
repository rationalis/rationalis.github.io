Hi, my name is Jimmy Ye, and I'm a recent graduate of [University of California,
San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), with a MS in Computer Science; I also obtained my
BS in Computer Science, with a minor in mathematics, from UCSD in 2018.

I hope to use this blog to write mostly about topics which are at least *partly*
technical in nature. I'm personally most interested in developments towards
artificial general intelligence, but my interests also range across many other
fields of CS, mathematics, and more.
