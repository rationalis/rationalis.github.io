Hi, my name is Jimmy Ye. I intend to use this blog to write mostly about topics
which are at least *partly* technical in nature. I'm personally most interested
in developments towards artificial general intelligence, but my interests also
range across many other fields of CS, mathematics, and more.

In terms of educational background, I graduated in 2019 from
[University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), with a MS in Computer
Science, specializing in AI; I also obtained my BS in Computer Science, with a
minor in mathematics, from UCSD in 2018.
