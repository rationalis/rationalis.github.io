Hi, my name is Jimmy Ye, and I'm currently in my third year of completing my BS
in Computer Science, with a minor in mathematics,
at [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu). My goal is to
contribute as much as I can to the (I believe) inevitable creation of artificial
general intelligence.

I use this blog primarily to post expositions on my own "work"; I use the term
loosely to describe any work (*n.* something done or made) which I have
dedicated time and effort into, which will usually consist of code or math or
both. Secondarily, I'll post thoughts or opinions on any of a variety of topics,
including my personal life, technology, politics, and philosophy.

A relatively up-to-date, online version of my résumé is available
on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmy-ye-a3333b82). A fully
updated, single-page, PDF version of my résumé is available upon request. You
can contact me at [jiy162@ucsd.edu](mailto:jiy162@ucsd.edu).
