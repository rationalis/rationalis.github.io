Hi, my name is Jimmy Ye, and I'm currently in my third year of completing my BS
in Computer Science, with a minor in mathematics, at 
[University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu). My goal is to 
contribute as much as I can to the (I believe) inevitable creation of artificial 
general intelligence.

A relatively up-to-date, online version of my résumé is available on 
[my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmy-ye-a3333b82). A definitely 
up-to-date, single-page, PDF version of my résumé is available upon request. 
You can contact me at [jiy162@ucsd.edu](mailto:jiy162@ucsd.edu).
